# Bellroy Streams and Levels

## Bellroy Streams

This doc is to help us clarify our meaning of the ‘streams’ of types of work that exist in Bellroy.

**Notes:**

*   A business needs to have coverage of all of the streams to function effectively, but may not need the same amount of coverage from each stream.
*   An individual may have skill in some streams, but not others
*   An individual can have differing level of skill across the streams
*   Each role will need to be supported by the right amount of each stream.  The incumbent person will bring some of the skills, and the people and systems around them need to provide the rest:
    *   _Technical_: so they can do their day to day work
    *   _People_: so that their welfare and development are provided for
    *   _Operations_: so that there are systems to help their work contribute
    *   _Coordination_: so that they are connected to others and the larger goals
    *   _Modelling_: so that the work they do will achieve the business goals

    <td>Technical</td>
    <td>
      <p>The work has a strong skill based aspect to it, that is domain specific (eg. web development, soft goods design, accounting). Technical skills are commonly developed through a combination of study, training and work experience. These are the skills that are transferable from one company to another, but generally not from one industry to another.</p>
      <p>All of the direct work is done here. If the customer can see it, Technical skill was involved (sole exception: see full automation in Operations).</p>
      <p>If someone with a high level of Operations skill has had time to improve the systems, excellent product might be produced with only low Technical skill (eg. assembly line or McDonalds restaurant).</p>
      <p>L1: Unqualified.<br>
      L5: Very competent.<br>
      L10: Jiro (he who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi">dreams of sushi</a>).</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>People</td>
    <td>
      <p>The work is primarily about caring for the welfare and development of other people (directly).</p>
      <p>It's about helping others with skill acquisition, motivation, personal and professional development, progressing and improving the other skills.</p>
      <p>Aspects about setting policy or designing how we 'should' do this are not in this stream (they are in technical or modelling).</p>
      <p>Without coverage with People skill, the Technical skills won't improve, and the Technical workers will get demotivated and stop working.</p>
      <p>With <em>authority</em> this looks like a manager coaching and inspiring their team. Without <em>authority</em> this can still be spectacular - inspiring others to read, coaching peers, juniors and managers, focusing people's attention on <em>developing</em> their <em>craft</em> rather than just punching out widgets.</p>
      <p>Component skills: psychology, models of learning styles, modelling other people's models and crafting learning experiences for them.</p>
      <p>(It's possible to have a skill split here and know how to develop yourself and maintain your own motivation, but not help others do the same.)</p>
      <p>L1: Skill development and motivation stagnant.<br>
      L5: Inspiring a small team to maintain moderate personal and professional development (or excelling in your own personal development).<br>
      L10: Inspiring and enabling rapid growth and development for the whole company (or surging to mastery through self-directed learning).</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Operations</td>
    <td>
      <p>The work is primarily about 'keeping the machine running', or tuning and improving the machine so that more can be done with less (less time, fewer resources or with lower technical skill).</p>
      <p>It's about running processes to make sure that the whole system keeps running smoothly, then improving it so that it runs better than it did before. In general, the operations skill is about knowing how things are done, and about working to make that happen, and in later stages seeing how things <em>could be done</em>, and improving systems and processes so that they function better and better.</p>
      <p><em>Work that is about how systems run generally, and about using theoretical models to improve systems is a technical or a modelling skill.</em></p>
      <p>Without coverage with the Operations skill, the machine will eventually stop running (entropy eventually burns out even the Sun), and improvement requires ever increasing Technical skill.</p>
      <p>Some systems can be nearly fully automated by people with good enough Operations skills, shifting the Technical work from making the product to maintaining the system (because until we get AGI, all systems need <em>some</em> maintenance). A system reaching this level of automation is the only time actual customer facing product can be produced without direct Technical work of some kind (and even then, Technical work is required to stop the machine from breaking down).</p>
      <p>L1: Just work in the system, never improving it.<br>
      L5: Constantly making small adjustments to the systems you interact with. Whenever something goes less than perfectly, you start thinking about how the system could be tweaked.<br>
      L10: You keep automating yourself out of a job, then getting another job because you're so awesome.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Coordination</td>
    <td>
      <p>The work primarily involves sharing of information and bringing the relevant people and processes together such that efforts of many people are all working towards a goal effectively.</p>
      <p>Moving information around so that the right Technical work is done in the right order, and all of the relevant resources are ready in time for the work that needs them.</p>
      <p>Without coverage with Coordination skill, the Technical work might be excellent, but it'll be excellent to the wrong spec, or too much of it (or not enough) was made, or not made yet at all because the Technical workers are waiting for resources.</p>
      <p>At a high level this skill involves persuasion, communication, inspiration, conflict resolution, and whatever else is required to get the Technical work to arrive at the right time and ready for downstream processes to start. Someone with stellar skills in Coordination and very low skills in everything else would almost never make a decision themselves, other than deciding who else needs to make each decision, but they would need the taste to judge what does need review by other Technical skills.</p>
      <p>L1: "I just do the things I know how to do, when I am told to do them."<br>
      L5: Always thinking ahead to what you and others will need tomorrow and next week.<br>
      L10: Tasks from all over the company are completed just in time with minimal work in progress, minimal confusion, minimal waiting and excellent taste for what "done" looks like.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Modelling</td>
    <td>
      <p>The work involves building and updating models of how the business functions, and using tools like OKRs to guide the work of the organisation.</p>
      <p>Without coverage with Modelling skill, the Technical work might be excellent, but no one wants to buy it, or we're selling it at a loss, or Google just released their own version of the product we've worked on for the last four years and it's better than ours.</p>
      <p>If your team all have very low levels in this skill, the work needs to be precisely described so that people don't need to understand why it's being done. If enough of your middle managers and leading hands have middling skill in Modelling you can give high level direction and expect your staff to work out the details on their own.</p>
      <p>L1: "I don't know why we do what we do. I just do what I'm told."<br>
      L5: Able to act with considerable independence given high level strategic direction.<br>
      L10: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger#%22Elementary,_worldly_wisdom%22">Charlie Munger</a> level world models; not just our business but our whole industry is easy for you to understand.</p>

## Bellroy Levels

This doc is to help us clarify our meaning of the ‘levels’ of skill that exist in Bellroy.

**Notes:**

*   A business needs to have the right number of people at each skill level to do the work.
*   It is important to have a good match between the skill of the individual, and the level of skill needed to do the job:
    *   Skill of individual is significantly _greater_ than skill required = Job probably gets done well, but person is bored (this is a waste)
    *   Skill of individual is significantly _less_ than skill required = Job won’t get done well and person likely to be stressed.
    *   An individual can have differing levels of skill across the streams
*   Providing the right amount of challenge and support in a role will help people to develop through the levels.
